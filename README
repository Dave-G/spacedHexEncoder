Used to create spaced hex files from plaintext messages. 
The files can be passed around with a hash used to verify integrity.

spacedHexEncoder
Takes user input and encodes it to a space-seperated hex file with a matching
hash file that can be decoded and checked by the second python script.

spacedHexDecoder
Takes in a space-seperated hex file and an accompanying hash file to decode
and check against each other for data consistency. Files are deleted upon use.
